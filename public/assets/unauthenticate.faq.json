        "q":"How do I perform a quick scan? ",
        "a":"After logging into ZeroThreat, go to the dashboard, enter your target URL in the central input field, select a nearby scanning server from the dropdown, and click 'Start Scan.' This initiates an unauthenticated scan limited to publicly accessible pages.",

    {
        "q":"What\u2019s the benefit of choosing a nearby scanning server? ",
        "a":"A scanning server close to your target reduces network latency, speeds up scan times, and boosts result accuracy by minimizing disruptions. It\u2019s also helpful when your application has location restriction, restricting access to certain geographic regions. A nearby server ensures the scan can reach the target effectively, making it key for efficient and reliable scanning in such cases. "

## Configuration Overview

ZeroThreat On-Prem provides several configuration options that allow you to tailor how the platform behaves within your environment. These configurations are essential for AI enabled features, Mail Server testing and Automated Pentest configuration.

Configuration settings are managed at the **organization level** and are typically handled by security engineers, platform teams, or administrators responsible for maintaining the On-Prem deployment.

The Configuration section includes:

* **AI Features** for analysis and reporting
* **Mail Server Configuration** for system notifications
* **Automated Pentest Configuration** for continuous testing

Each of these areas is covered in detail on its own page.

**Available configuration guides**

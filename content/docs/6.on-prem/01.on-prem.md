## Introduction to On-Prem Scanning

ZeroThreat **On-Prem** enables you to run security scans entirely within your own infrastructure, without routing scan traffic through the cloud. Instead, the scanning engine is deployed locally inside your internal network, allowing you to assess applications and APIs that are not publicly accessible.

This deployment model is especially useful for organizations that operate behind firewalls, within private networks, or under regulatory and compliance constraints that limit data movement. On-Prem scanning ensures that sensitive environments can still be tested without compromising network boundaries.

Common use cases include:

* Scanning internal or private applications
* Environments with restricted outbound internet access
* Organizations with strict compliance or data residency requirements

ZeroThreat On-Prem is supported on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**. The installation and configuration flow remains same across all operating systems.

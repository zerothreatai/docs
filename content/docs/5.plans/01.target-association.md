This guide walks you through associating a target with your plan, understanding the cooling logic, and how to manage or deassociate targets if needed.

## Prerequisites

Make sure:

* You’ve purchased a **Professional Plan** under the correct organization.
* At least one target slot in the subscription is still **unassigned**.
* You have permission/user access to manage subscriptions for the organization.

## Step 1: View Active Subscriptions

1. Go to **Organization Settings** in ZeroThreat.
2. Select the relevant organization.

3. Navigate to the **Active Subscriptions** tab.

::
4. You’ll see your current usage, such as `Available Targets: 1/3`, which means you’ve purchased 3 targets in subscription, and 1 is currently assigned.

###### The **Active Subscriptions** tab will only appear if your organization has Professional Plan active.

3. Click **Associate** to confirm.

Once done, the selected target will be linked to your Professional Plan and ready for unlimited scanning.

## Cooling Period Explained

After association, each target enters a **30-day cooling period**.

* During cooling period: You can **freely reassign** the subscription to a different target.
* After 30 days or **once a scan is started** (on the associated target): The cooling period ends immediately and the target remains fixed to the subscription for the rest of the billing cycle.

This window is designed to allow for correcting accidental associations.

## De-associating a Target

You can **de-associate** a target from the subscription at any time.

### Step 1: Access the Assigned Targets

1. Go to **Organization Settings** and select your organization.
2. Open the **Active Subscriptions** tab.&#x20;
3. Click on **Available Targets** to see all the bound and unbound targets.

### Step 2: Remove the binding

1. Toggle off the **Assign to Subscription Plan** button for the target you wish to de-associate.

2. Confirm the target De-association.

### Behaviour Based on Timing:

* **If within cooling period**: The target is immediately de-associated. The slot becomes available for reassignment.
* **If cooling period is over or once a scan is started** (on the associated target): The de-association will take effect at the end of the billing cycle. Until then, scans can still run on the associated target.

### Conclusion
    
Binding targets to your subscription is required to enable scanning under your plan. The cooling period gives you time to fix mistakes, and the de-association process is built to protect ongoing scan activity without any interruptions.

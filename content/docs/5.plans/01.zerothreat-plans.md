## ZeroThreat Plans Overview

ZeroThreat offers multiple plans designed to support different security testing needs — from individual practitioners and small teams to large enterprises and managed security providers.

Each plan provides a different level of scanning capacity, automation, integrations, reporting, and deployment flexibility. This page explains the available plans and their capabilities so that security teams and decision makers can choose the most appropriate option for their organization.

***

### Plan Categories

ZeroThreat plans are grouped by customer type:

* **Free** – Long-term free tier with limited capabilities
* **Professional** – For security teams running regular cloud or on-demand scans
* **Enterprise** – For organizations and service providers requiring scale, automation, governance, and private deployment

***

### Free Plan

#### Best for: Individuals and small teams getting started with DAST

The Free Plan provides ongoing access to ZeroThreat with limited scanning and reporting capabilities. It is intended for evaluation, and lightweight testing, and does not provide access to paid or enterprise features.

**Included**

* 1 parallel scan per host
* 5 scans on signup (limited report format)
* 1 free scan credit added each month (limited report format)
* Partial Scan Report with limited visibility into found vulnerabilties

**Not included**

* Full comprehensive Scan Report&#x20;
* Re-testing
* CI/CD integrations
* Issue tracking
* Notification Integration
* Production-safe testing
* Agentic AI Pentesting
* Custom attack templates
* Advanced reporting and branding

> <span style="font-style: normal !important; display: inline-block; width: 100%;"> ℹ️ **Limited Scan Report Format (Free Plan) :** </span>
> <p style="padding-left: 25px; font-style: normal">The Free Plan delivers scan reports in a restricted format that demonstrates the scanner's detection capabilities while limiting full access to findings. When a vulnerability is identified, the complete HTTP request and response details are shown only for the first occurrence. Additional instances of the same vulnerability are redacted and obscured. This same restriction extends to other security findings including outdated packages, SSL/certificate vulnerabilities, and cloud misconfigurations, which also appear partially hidden. In essence, this format proves the scanner can identify security issues in your application, but withholds comprehensive details across all findings which are reserved for premium plan subscribers.</p>

### Professional Plans

Professional plans are designed for security teams that require regular scanning with predictable billing or flexible, usage-based testing.

title: Server Ports Scan
description: Open ports on a web server can be potential entry points for attackers. The <strong>Server Port Scan</strong> module identifies all open ports on the target server and assesses their security risks. Some ports are necessary for functionality, while others might expose unnecessary attack surfaces. Understanding which ports are accessible and their potential security implications helps in securing the server effectively.

## Port Analysis

This module provides a comprehensive breakdown of all detected open ports and the services running on them. Each port is analyzed based on its function, security risk, and necessity for public exposure. Port like **443 (HTTPS) is** typically required for web applications, while others, such as **21 (FTP) or 23 (Telnet)**, may pose security risks if left exposed without proper safeguards.

For each open port, the system evaluates how dangerous it is to keep it accessible. Ports associated with **remote administration tools, file transfer services, or database connections** are often targeted by attackers and should be restricted where possible.&#x20;

If an open port is identified as a potential risk, the report highlights its security implications, including whether it is commonly exploited in attacks, or exposes unnecessary services to the internet. Beyond identifying risks, the analysis also provides recommendations on whether a port should remain open to the public. In cases where a port must be exposed, best practices are suggested.&#x20;

The goal is to provide a clear understanding of the security impact of each port and actionable steps to mitigate potential threats.

## Scanning Section

The **Scanning/Scanned Page** inside the Scanner section is the most relevant when a scan is in progress. It provides real-time insights into the scan’s progress, showing what parts of the target application are being analyzed and how far along the scan has progressed.

This page helps you **track and monitor** the scan efficiently.

### URLs Being Crawled

The scan categorizes URLs into different states as they are being tested:\
<icon class="fa-solid fa-hourglass-half"/>**Crawling Unauthenticated** – URLs discovered without logging in.\
<icon class="fa-solid fa-hourglass-half"/>**Crawling Authenticated** – URLs accessed after authentication.\
<icon class="fa-solid fa-hourglass-half"/>**OWASP Top 10** – URLs where vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top 10 list are being actively tested.

Each category helps in understanding which parts of the application are accessible and tested under different conditions.

### Scan Status & Progress

* Displays a **real-time percentage** of the scan’s completion.
* Helps you estimate how long the scan might take to finish.

## Crawled URIs

The **Crawled URIs** page shows the full sitemap generated by ZeroThreat, showing all the URIs that the tool has crawled during a scan. This feature enables users to easily visualize the structure of the application and identify both authenticated and unauthenticated areas of the site.

The sitemap is displayed in a tree structure, making it easy to navigate through the application’s resources. Each node represents a directory or file, and you can expand or collapse sections to find what you need quickly.

You can filter the URIs by whether they were crawled after authentication or not, helping you focus on different areas of the site.

## Form Requests

Forms play a crucial role in web applications, handling user input in various scenarios, from login pages and search bars to registration and feedback forms. The **Form Requests** section lists all forms detected during the scan, giving you visibility into potential security risks related to user input.

Clicking on a  individual form provides all the inputs in the form and other relevant information.

###### Forms are common attack vectors for **SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF**, reviewing this section helps identify weak points where user input handling can be improved.

title: Retest Vulnerability
description: ZeroThreat’s **Retest** feature allows you to validate whether a vulnerability has been successfully fixed without having to run a full scan all over again. This is especially helpful for developers and security teams who want to quickly check if their fix actually worked.
---




Instead of waiting for the next scheduled scan, you can run a focused check on individual findings or a group of issues, directly from the scan report. The results provide immediate clarity on whether the vulnerability is still exploitable or has been remediated.



## Retesting a Specific Vulnerability

If you’ve fixed a particular issue and want to check if the patch worked, you can trigger a live test for that vulnerability:

1. Open the relevant **Scan Report** from the Scans section (<img src="https://zerothreat.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1825008717-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fs6Y7hKb1RwZWFZo4EnUm%252Fuploads%252F2WAzy404Qwih5zrE9v8M%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dbb82a4e6-558c-439b-a252-e14cda4941d5&#x26;width=37&#x26;dpr=4&#x26;quality=100&#x26;sign=60d454df&#x26;sv=2" alt="" data-size="line">) in ZeroThreat.
2. Click on the vulnerability you want to verify and open the individual finding.
3. Click on the **Request Detail** section.
4. Click the **“Test this Vulnerability”** (<img src="/Images/image (251).png" alt="" data-size="line">) button.

###### This action will trigger a targeted test using the original payload and request details. No other parts of your application will be affected.

5. Wait around **1–2 minutes** for the test to complete.

6. Click on the **“Live Test Results”** button to view the outcome. The result will show whether the issue was **successfully fixed (Passed)** or **still exploitable (Failed)**.

## Retesting Multiple Vulnerabilities

If you’ve deployed multiple fixes across the app, you can use the bulk retest feature to validate multiple vulnerabilities at once.

1. Go to the **top-right corner** inside a Scan Report page.
2. Click the **“Retest”** button to open the retest panel.

3. You’ll be given three flexible retesting options:

* **Retest All** – Revalidates every vulnerability detected in the scan.
* **Filter by Severity** – Select severity levels like _Critical_, or _Medium_ to retest only high-impact findings.
* **Custom Selection** – Manually choose specific vulnerabilities you want to retest.

Once initiated, ZeroThreat will rerun the relevant tests and show an updated status for each vulnerability.

## Interpreting Retest Results

Each vulnerability tested will show one of the following outcomes:

* ✅ **Passed** – The issue is no longer exploitable; your fix is working as intended.
* ❌ **Failed** – The vulnerability still exists and may need a revised patch.

You can review these results immediately from inside the Re-Test section inside Scan Report, making it easy to check status of each finding.

## Best Practices for Retesting

* **Choose the right approach:** Depending on the situation, you can retest a group of vulnerability, a single finding, or run a full rescan pick what makes the most sense for your usecase.
* **Save time with targeted checks:** Retesting individual findings is a quick and efficient way for developers to verify patches without waiting for a full scan to complete.
* **Focus on what matters:** Start by retesting _Critical_ and Medium vulnerabilities to quickly reduce the biggest risks

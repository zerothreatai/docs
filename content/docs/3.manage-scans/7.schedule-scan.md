description: Schedule Scan helps you automate your scanning routines by letting you set scans to run at specific times. Whether you need a one-time or a recurring scan, you can choose from daily, weekly, or monthly schedules.

This feature reduces manual effort and ensures that your applications are scanned regularly without having to initiate each scan manually.



## Why Use Scheduled Scans?

* Run scans on a regular basis without manual triggers.
* Detect vulnerabilities early.
* Stay aligned with compliance requirements.
* Automatically scan after new deployments or feature releases.

###### **Example Scenario**: If your team deploys updates every Sunday night, schedule a scan for Monday at 2:00 AM to check for issues before the start of the workday.

###### Note: Only targets that are **verified** and where you have **scan privileges** will be shown.
::

### 4. Set Timezone

Choose the **timezone** in which the scan should be performed. This ensures scans run at the correct local time. Setting the timezone is particularly useful when you are part of an organization with team members located in different regions. It helps coordinate scan timings across global teams, ensuring scans align with local schedules without confusion or conflicts.

### 7. Set the Repeat Cycle

Decide how often you want the scan to run:

* **One-Time Only** – Good for ad-hoc assessments.
* **Daily** – Ideal for dynamic apps or frequent deployments.
* **Weekly** – Common for most teams; choose a specific day of the week.
* **Monthly** – Schedule scans for a specific day of the month.

**Examples:**

* Scan every Monday at 3:30 AM — Weekly review.
* Scan on the 1st of each month at 2:00 AM — Monthly audit.

### 8. Add Authentication (Optional)

If your scan requires login or authentication, then select an existing **Authenticated Scan Template**.

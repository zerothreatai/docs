###### Note: Only targets that are **verified** and where you have **scan privileges** will be shown.

### 4. Set Timezone

Choose the **timezone** in which the scan should be performed. This ensures scans run at the correct local time. Setting the timezone is particularly useful when you are part of an organization with team members located in different regions. It helps coordinate scan timings across global teams, ensuring scans align with local schedules without confusion or conflicts.

### 7. Set the Repeat Cycle

Decide how often you want the scan to run:

* **One-Time Only** – Good for ad-hoc assessments.
* **Daily** – Ideal for dynamic apps or frequent deployments.
* **Weekly** – Common for most teams; choose a specific day of the week.
* **Monthly** – Schedule scans for a specific day of the month.

**Examples:**

* Scan every Monday at 3:30 AM — Weekly review.
* Scan on the 1st of each month at 2:00 AM — Monthly audit.

### 8. Add Authentication (Optional)

If your scan requires login or authentication, then select an existing **Authenticated Scan Template**.

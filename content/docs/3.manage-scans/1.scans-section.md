## Scan List and Sorting

When you access the _Scans_ section, you'll see a comprehensive list of your scans. To help you navigate and organize these scans effectively, you have several options:

- **Group By**: Use the _Group By_ <span><img src="/Images/image (54).png" alt="" data-size="line"></span> button to sort scans based on:

  - **Hostname**: Group scans according to their respective hostnames.
  - **Organizations**: Sort scans based on the organizations they belong to.

- **Default View**: If no sorting option is applied, scans will be displayed based on the most recent activity.

###### If you don’t see the “**Download Report**” option, it’s possible that the scan is still in progress or your account doesn't have the appropriate permissions to download the report (Example: Report Reader Role).&#x20;

## Report Types

Depending on your purpose, you can choose from the following report types:

* **Full Scan Report** – A detailed technical report containing all identified vulnerabilities, HTTP request/response data, remediation guidance, and scan metadata. Best suited for developers and security teams.
* **Executive Summary** – A high-level overview focusing on severity distribution, risk trends, and compliance status ideal for management and stakeholders.

* **Severity-Specific Report** – Download reports filtered by severity level (e.g., Critical, Medium, Low or informational only) to focus on specific type of issues.

* **Compliance Report** – ZeroThreat maps scan findings to standards such as **GDPR**, **OWASP Top 10**, **HIPAA**, **NIST**, and **ISO 27001**. These tailored reports make it easy to identify gaps against specific frameworks and are useful for audits.

All reports are exported in **PDF format**, designed to be clear, professional, and easy to share.

## Best Practices

* **Use severity-specific reports** during remediation sprints to reduce distraction from low-priority findings.
* **Send executive summaries** in stakeholder review meetings to align on security posture without overwhelming technical details.
* **Save compliance reports** as audit resource when preparing for regulatory reviews or certifications.

## API Discovery from Code

API Discovery from Code in ZeroThreat enables users to identify and analyze all API endpoints that are exposed within a web application without relying on static code analysis or schema parsing. Instead, ZeroThreat employs a dynamic, runtime approach to uncover APIs through comprehensive application interaction during scans.

This technique ensures that all reachable endpoints are discovered by simulating real user behavior, such as navigating through the application, clicking buttons, and submitting forms. This allows for effective and accurate API inventory generation, even in complex or dynamic single-page applications (SPAs).

***

### How It Works

ZeroThreat detects APIs as part of its dynamic scanning process. The detection happens in real-time by crawling through the entire application and simulating actual user interaction. This includes:

* Navigating all accessible routes and pages
* Interacting with UI components such as buttons, dropdowns, and tabs
* Submitting forms with different types of input data
* Capturing all client-server communication during scan sessions

By observing how the application interacts with backend services, ZeroThreat compiles a detailed inventory of API endpoints, including HTTP methods, parameter structures, request bodies, and expected responses.

### Where to View Detected APIs

All discovered APIs and its vulnerabilities are listed under the **Detected APIs** section and **Crawled URIs** in the **Scan Report** tab of the ZeroThreat portal.&#x20;

Each detected API entry includes:

* Endpoint path (e.g., `/api/user/profile`)
* HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
* Detected parameters and payload structure
* Response of the API and Evidence if there is a reported vulnerability

This section gives teams a centralized view of the application's live API landscape based on how users and clients interact with it during runtime.

### Benefits of ZeroThreat's Approach

* **No Code Access Required**: Unlike AST-based techniques, ZeroThreat does not require access to the source code or repository.
* **Real User Simulation**: Ensures APIs are discovered based on actual usage paths, reducing false positives and revealing hidden endpoints that may not be documented.
* **Effective for SPAs and Dynamic Interfaces**: Capable of interacting with modern web applications where routes and API calls are rendered dynamically.
* **Full Coverage**: Scans cover both frontend and backend integrations by interacting with the application end-to-end.

### Integration with Security Testing

Detected APIs play a key role in ZeroThreat’s DAST engine. The discovered API endpoints help with security testing workflows, allowing scanners to:

* Test API-specific vulnerabilities
* Generate detailed vulnerability reports tied to API operations

This ensures better coverage and reduces the risk of leaving critical endpoints untested.

### Summary

ZeroThreat’s API Discovery from Code is designed to be a practical, real-world solution that mirrors how applications are used in production. By combining deep crawling, UI interaction, and analysis, it creates a comprehensive view of the application’s API surface without requiring access to code or relying on static analysis.

Explore the **Detected APIs** section in your Scan Report to gain full visibility into your application’s exposed interfaces and improve your overall security posture.

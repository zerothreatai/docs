3. **Enter User Details**  
   Provide the following information:

   - **Full Name**: Enter the user's full name.
   - **Email Address**: Provide the email address where the user will receive their invitation.
   - **Select Role**: Assign an appropriate role for the user based on their responsibilities. Choose from:
     - **Owner**: Full control over settings and billing.
     - **Administrator**: Broad access without billing controls.
     - **Contributor**: Limited access to execute scans and manage scan profiles.
     - **Reader**: View-only access to scan reports and configurations.

   **Example**:

   - Full Name: `Alice Braun`
   - Email Address: `Alice_braun@zerothreat-demo.com`
   - Role: _Contributor_ – Ideal for a software developer who needs to run scans and analyze results but doesn’t need access to manage account settings or user roles.

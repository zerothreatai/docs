## Steps to Add a User

2. **Click Add User**  
   Click the <img src="/image (84).png" alt="" width="30px" data-size="original" style="display:inline; margin-top:12px;"> **(Add User)** button to start the process. This will open a form where you can input user details.

3. **Enter User Details**  
   Provide the following information:
   * **Full Name**: Enter the user's full name.
   * **Email Address**: Provide the email address where the user will receive their invitation.
   * **Select Role**: Assign an appropriate role for the user based on their responsibilities. Choose from:
     * **Owner**: Full control over settings and billing.
     * **Administrator**: Broad access without billing controls.
     * **Contributor**: Limited access to execute scans and manage scan profiles.
     * **Reader**: View-only access to scan reports and configurations.

   **Example**:
   * Full Name: `Alice Braun`
   * Email Address: `Alice_braun@zerothreat-demo.com`
   * Role: *Contributor* – Ideal for a software developer who needs to run scans and analyze results but doesn’t need access to manage account settings or user roles.

   ###### Ensure that the email address is correct to avoid delays or sending sensitive access information to the wrong person.

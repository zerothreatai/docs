##### **Tip: Ensure Compliance with Data Residency Requirements**

###### Double-check the storage location to comply with any regional or organizational data governance policies. For instance, regulations like **GDPR (EU)**, **CCPA (US)**, **HIPAA (US)**, **PIPEDA (Canada)**, **LGPD (Brazil)**, and others often mandate that sensitive data is stored and processed within specific geographical boundaries. Proper configuration ensures compliance and avoids legal complications.

## Pro Tips for Setting Up an Organization

* **Use Descriptive Names:** Choose a name that reflects the team, department, or purpose of the organization. This makes it easier to identify, especially when managing multiple organizations.
* **Plan Your Data Storage Location:** Consider factors like team location, regulatory requirements, and data access speed when selecting the storage location.
* **Keep It Organized:** Periodically review and update your organization’s role based access to ensure it stays relevant as your team grows or changes.

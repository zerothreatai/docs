## Organizations

Organizations provide a structured way to group Users, Projects, and Targets under a single entity, making management more efficient. By organizing your resources in this manner, you can easily manage permissions, roles, and scopes, ensuring that the right users have the right level of access.

You can create multiple organizations within a single account. Each organization operates independently, allowing you to tailor settings, roles, and permissions to specific needs.&#x20;

Example, A developer who needs access to specific features, such as starting scans and viewing reports, but you don’t want them to have full access to the entire account. Instead of giving them the account, you can give them project level access and assign them a Contributor role within that project.&#x20;

## User Roles

### 2. Administrator Access

### 3. Contributor Access

- **Limited Access**: Contributors focus on specific actions like executing scans and creating scan profiles for authenticated targets.
- **Responsibilities**: They can start vulnerability scans on assigned targets, create login sequence profiles, and contribute to ongoing projects without managing user roles or account-wide settings.
- **Example**: A Contributor might record the authentication flow for a web application and initiate a scan but won't have access to billing or user management settings.

---

### 4. Reader Access

- **View-Only Access**: Readers have restricted access, allowing them to view scan results and configurations without making any changes.
- **Responsibilities**: Readers analyze reports and configurations to understand vulnerabilities but cannot initiate scans or modify any settings.
- **Example**: A Reader might review scan reports to identify security weaknesses but will need assistance from a Contributor or Administrator to address them.

## Examples of Real-World Use

- **Owner and Administrators**: The Owner of an organization might delegate day-to-day management of scan operations to Administrators while retaining control over billing and subscription.
- **Contributors and Readers**: In a development team, Contributors handle scan executions and report creation, while Readers like team leads or clients review the findings for decision-making.

## Authenticated Scan

When scanning web applications for vulnerabilities, authenticated sections often hold critical functionality and sensitive data. These areas are typically protected by login mechanisms, making them essential to include in your scans. The ZeroThreat Chrome Extension bridges this gap by enabling you to record login sequences and effectively scan these protected sections.

This extension simplifies the process of capturing login sequence. By recording your interactions during login, ZeroThreat ensures these workflows are replicated during scanning, allowing the scanner to access and test all areas of your application.

Using the Chrome Extension to record a login sequence is a straightforward process. It involves selecting your target application, navigating through the login process, and tagging the necessary actions (like login, logout, and authenticated requests). Once recorded, this sequence can be used to perform an authenticated scan, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of your application’s security.

##### **Before you start**

###### Ensure that the latest version of ZeroThreat Chrome Recorder extension is installed on your browser.
::

### 1. Select Your Target

* In the dashboard within the ZeroThreat portal begin by clicking on **Scan the Target** and choose the application you wish to scan.

 <!-- <img src="/image (114).png" alt="" width="563"> -->
::


### 2. Open the Authenticated Scan Section

* Once you’ve selected your target, go to the **Authenticated Scan** section.
* Click on the **"Record Authentication Sequence"** button <img src="/image (98).png" width="28%" alt="" data-size="inline" style="display:inline; margin:0px; margin-bottom:8px;"> This will open the selected web application in a new tab along with the ZeroThreat Recorder Chrome window.

<!-- bgStyle=" bg-slate-50 rounded-md border border-red-300 tracking-wide text-red-500" -->
 ##### **Minimize the ZeroThreat Recorder Chrome window**

###### You can minimize the recorder window but ensure the that it remains open throughout the recording process.
::
**Visit** [Troubleshooting: Extension Not Opening](../troubleshoot "mention") if the extension doesn't open automatically in new tab along with target.
### 3. Configure the Recorder

* You will be prompted to configure the Recorder before starting the recording.
  * **Name the Template**: Give your recording sequence a meaningful name for easy identification later.
  * **Choose the Content Rendering Type**: Select whether the application uses server-side rendering (e.g., WordPress, PHP, ASP.NET) or client-side rendering (e.g., Angular, React, Vue).                &#x20;

   <img src="/image (115).png" alt="" data-size="original" style="display:block; margin:30px auto;" >


### 4. Start Recording

* Once configured, click on the **"Start Recording"** button. This will begin capturing all the HTTP requests, user interactions, and host data essential for a successful scan.

### 5. Login and Navigate the target application

* Now Log in to the target application using your credentials.

<!-- <img src="/image (100).png" alt="" width="242"> -->
::


* After logging in, navigate few authenticated areas of the target application. The Recorder will capture all these actions, which are crucial for scanning protected sections of the app.

<h6>Avoid performing any non-essential actions during this session to ensure only relevant interactions are recorded.</h6>
::

### 6. Log Out and Stop Recording

* Once you have navigated few authenticated sections, log out of the target application. <img src="/image (102).png" width="17%" alt="" style="display:inline; margin:0px; margin-bottom:0px; translate: var(--tw-translate-x) -7px;"/>


* Click on **"Stop Recording"** <img src="/image (103).png" alt="" width="120px" data-size="line" style="display:inline; margin:0px; margin-bottom:0px; translate: var(--tw-translate-x) -7px;"> to stop the recording.

### 7. Tag the HTTP Requests

After stopping the recording, you'll need to tag the captured HTTP requests:

* **Login Action**: Tag the HTTP request responsible for logging in.&#x20;<img src="/image (108).png" alt="" style="display:block; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:30px;" >

<!-- <img src="/image (108).png" alt=""> -->


* **Authenticated Requests**: Tag any HTTP requests that is only accessible after login.&#x20; <img src="/image (109).png" alt="" style="display:block; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:30px;" >




* **Log Out Action**: Tag the HTTP request responsible for logging out. <img src="/image (110).png" alt="" style="display:block; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:30px;" >

### 8. Review and Finalize the Recorded Data

* Click on **"Continue"** to proceed to the review section.
* In this section, you can review all the marked requests and make adjustments:
  * **Disallow Hosts**: You can choose to disallow certain hosts from being scanned, especially if they involve sensitive data or third-party services.
* Once reviewed, click on **"Save"** to save the recording or **"Save and Scan"** to start the authenticated scan immediately. &#x20;

### 9. Monitor the Scan

After starting the scan, monitor its progress and results in the **Scans** section of the Zero Threat portal.

### Tips & Cautions

* **Accurate Tagging**: Be sure to correctly tag the login, authenticated, and log-out HTTP requests. This ensures that the scanner performs a complete and accurate scan of all protected areas.
* **Avoid Non-Essential Actions**: During the recording session, refrain from interacting with any part of the application that isn’t relevant to the authentication flow. This keeps your recorded data focused and clean.
* **Sensitive Data Handling**: If your application interacts with third-party services or contains sensitive data, review and adjust the recorded HTTP requests carefully to avoid scanning external or protected resources unintentionally.

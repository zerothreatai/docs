## Authenticated Scan

When scanning web applications for vulnerabilities, authenticated sections often hold critical functionality and sensitive data. These areas are typically protected by login mechanisms, making them essential to include in your scans. The ZeroThreat Chrome Extension bridges this gap by enabling you to record login sequences and effectively scan these protected sections.

This extension simplifies the process of capturing login sequence. By recording your interactions during login, ZeroThreat ensures these workflows are replicated during scanning, allowing the scanner to access and test all areas of your application.

Using the Chrome Extension to record a login sequence is a straightforward process. It involves selecting your target application, navigating through the login process, and tagging the necessary actions (like login, logout, and authenticated requests). Once recorded, this sequence can be used to perform an authenticated scan, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of your application’s security.

Review Recorded Template Information
::

Here configure the following:

* **Name the Template**: Assign a meaningful name to your recording for easy reference later.

::fiqure-img{width="563" source="/Images/image (198).png"}
Authentication Sequence Name
::

* **Choose the Content Rendering Type**: Select whether the application uses server-side rendering (e.g., WordPress, PHP, ASP.NET) or client-side rendering (e.g., Angular, React, Vue).

::fiqure-img{width="563" source="https://zerothreat.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1825008717-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fs6Y7hKb1RwZWFZo4EnUm%252Fuploads%252FB4sYKvomwfpDG7wUcJRy%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D45feb0b2-b150-4ba9-a129-f7107db8ea1c&#x26;width=768&#x26;dpr=4&#x26;quality=100&#x26;sign=afc7cbf1&#x26;sv=2"}
Rendering Engine Type
::

* Optionally, exclude certain hosts from being scanned. This is useful for skipping hosts with sensitive data or third-party integrations.

::fiqure-img{width="563" source="https://zerothreat.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1825008717-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fs6Y7hKb1RwZWFZo4EnUm%252Fuploads%252FPoHx5c1WIO1SKhCb16eF%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Df17ae145-3f0c-4241-a808-c2e9a1a3c534&#x26;width=768&#x26;dpr=4&#x26;quality=100&#x26;sign=faf050e6&#x26;sv=2"}
Allowed Hosts
::

* The next step is Authentication Page Marking. By default, ZeroThreat automatically marks: one request for login, one for an authenticated page, and one for logout. This helps the scanner perform more thorough scanning.

::fiqure-img{width="563" source="/Images/image (199).png"}
Authentication Page Marking
::

*   If needed, switch to the **Custom** option to manually tag these requests yourself:

    * First, select the login request as "Login.
    ::fiqure-img{width="563" source="/Images/image (200).png"}
    Tag Login Request
    ::

    * Then, select any request accessible only after login as "Authorized"
    ::fiqure-img{width="563" source="/Images/image (201).png"}
    Tag Authenticated Request
    ::

    * Lastly, select the logout request as "Logout." If you don’t see the logout request, you can also mark the page from where the logout action was performed. In our case we logged out from the batch-management page so we mark that as logout.
    ::fiqure-img{width="563" source="/Images/image (202).png"}
    Tag Logout Request
    ::

::hint{style="background-color:#f7fcff; border:1px solid #07405a33; color:#1e6995;" icon="circle-info" iconClass="text-sky-600"}
###### If your logout endpoint doesn’t show up in the recorded requests, don’t worry. Simply mark the last request from where you logged out of your application. This ensures proper tracking of the session flow.
::

### 6. Review and Finalize the Recorded Data

After reviewing the recording information you will have two options.

::fiqure-img{width="563" source="/Images/image (203).png"}
Save Template
::

* Click **Save and Exit** (<img src="/Images/image (195).png" alt="" data-size="line">) to store the recording sequence for later use.
* Click **Save and Start Scan** (<img src="/Images/image (196).png" alt="" data-size="line">) to launch the scan immediately using your selected scan server.

### **7. Monitor the Scan**

The scan will start immediately and you can track its progress and view results in the **Scans** section or **Recent Scans** section in the ZeroThreat portal.

### Tips & Cautions

- **Accurate Tagging**: Be sure to correctly tag the login, authenticated, and log-out HTTP requests. This ensures that the scanner performs a complete and accurate scan of all protected areas.
- **Avoid Non-Essential Actions**: During the recording session, refrain from interacting with any part of the application that isn’t relevant to the authentication flow. This keeps your recorded data focused and clean.
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: If your application interacts with third-party services or contains sensitive data, review and adjust the recorded HTTP requests carefully to avoid scanning external or protected resources unintentionally.

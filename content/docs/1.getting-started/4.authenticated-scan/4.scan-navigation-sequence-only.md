## Navigation Sequence Only

When testing web applications, you may need to scan specific sections or functionalities without scanning the entire site. The Navigation Sequence Only Scan in ZeroThreat allows you to do just that. By recording your navigation through selected areas, this feature ensures that only the pages you visit are scanned, providing a targeted security assessment.

## How to Perform a Navigation Sequence Only Scan?

::hint{ style="background-color:#fff4e6; color:#f97316; border:1px solid #f6d2b0;" icon="triangle-exclamation" iconClass="text-[#f97316]"}
##### **Before You Start**
###### Ensure the latest version of the ZeroThreat Chrome Recorder Extension is installed on your browser.
::

### **1. Select Your Target**

From the ZeroThreat dashboard, click **Scan the Target** and choose the web application you wish to scan. Next change the scanning server if required.

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (181).png"}
Scan The Target
  <!-- <img src="/Images/image (181).png" alt=""> -->
::


### **2. Under the Authenticated Scan Section**

Now under the Scan Method, click on **Start New Authenticated Scan** (<img src="/Images/image (182).png" alt="" style="display:inline ">) button. This will launch your target web application in a new tab, along with the ZeroThreat Recorder Chrome window.

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (206).png"}
Dashboard
  <!-- <img src="/Images/image (181).png" alt=""> -->
::
::hint{ style="background-color:#fef2f2; border:1px solid #e3b1b166; color:#cd3131;" icon="triangle-exclamation" iconClass="text-red-500"}
##### **Minimize the Recorder Window**
###### You can minimize the Recorder window, but keep it open throughout the process.
::

Visit [**Troubleshooting: Extension Not Opening**](../troubleshoot) if the extension doesn't open automatically in new tab along with target.

### **3. Configure the Recorder**

Once the extension is loaded, start by clicking on the **Stored Sequence Authentication** button. This feature allows ZeroThreat to store and replay your authentication details, making it ideal for scheduled scans and DevOps automation.

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (184).png"}
Choose Scan Authentication Method
  <!-- <img src="/Images/image (184).png" alt=""> -->
::


Next you’ll have two options **Full Scan** or **Scan Navigation Sequence Only**. A **Full Scan** covers the entire web application, while a **navigation sequence-only** scan focuses solely on the pages you visit during recording.

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (185).png"}
Choose Scan type
  <!-- <img src="/Images/image (185).png" alt=""> -->
::

Click the **Start Recording** (<img src="/Images/image (186).png" alt="" style="display:inline" data-size="line">) button to begin recording. The ZeroThreat Recorder will capture all your actions as you interact with the application.

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (187).png"}
Sequence Recording Started
  <!-- <img src="/Images/image (184).png" alt=""> -->
::

### **4. Log In and Navigate the Target Application**

As the recording begins log in to the target application using your credentials.&#x20;

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (100).png"}
Login to the target application
  <!-- <img src="/Images/image (100).png" alt=""> -->
::

After logging in, navigate through the specific sections or functionalities you want to scan. The Recorder will track these interactions, ensuring the scan is limited to only the visited pages—it won’t crawl or test beyond what you navigate. For our example we will scan the **Course List** section and visit all the pages and functionalities related to it.

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (188).png"}
Visiting Course List
  <!-- <img src="/Images/image (100).png" alt=""> -->
::

::hint{ style="background-color:#fff4e6; color:#f97316; border:1px solid #f6d2b0;" icon="triangle-exclamation" iconClass="text-[#f97316]"}
###### Avoid unnecessary actions to keep the recording focused on the intended areas.
::


When you’ve finished navigating the desired sections in our example the **Course List** functionality, click Stop Recording(<img src="/Images/image (189).png" alt="" style="display:inline" data-size="line">) to stop the recording. You’ll see an overview of your recorded sequence.

### **5. Configure the Template Information**

After stopping, an overview and configuration for the template will open.&#x20;

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (190).png"}
Review Recorded Template Information
  <!-- <img src="/Images/image (100).png" alt=""> -->
::

Here configure the following:

* **Name the Template**: Assign a meaningful name to your recording for easy reference later.

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (191).png"}
Authentication Sequence Name
  <!-- <img src="/Images/image (100).png" alt=""> -->
::

* **Choose the Content Rendering Type**: Select whether the application uses server-side rendering (e.g., WordPress, PHP, ASP.NET) or client-side rendering (e.g., Angular, React, Vue).

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (192).png"}
Rendering Engine Type
  <!-- <img src="/Images/image (100).png" alt=""> -->
::

* Optionally, exclude certain hosts from being scanned. This is useful for skipping hosts with sensitive data or third-party integrations.


::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (193).png"}
Allowed Hosts
  <!-- <img src="/Images/image (100).png" alt=""> -->
::

### **6. Review and Start the Scan**

After reviewing the recording information you will have two options.

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (194).png"}
Save template
::

* Click **Save and Exit**(<img src="/Images/image (195).png" alt="" style="display:inline" data-size="line">) to store the recording sequence for later use.
* Click **Save and Start Scan**(<img src="/Images/image (196).png" alt="" style="display:inline" data-size="line">) to launch the scan immediately using your selected scan server.

### **7. Monitor the Scan**

The scan will start immediately and you can track its progress and view results in the **Scans** section or **Recent Scans** section in the ZeroThreat portal.

## Tips & Cautions

* **Focused Navigation**: Only navigate the sections you want scanned. Unnecessary actions may include unintended pages in the recording.
* **Host Exclusion**: Use the exclude hosts feature to avoid scanning sensitive or third-party resources unintentionally.

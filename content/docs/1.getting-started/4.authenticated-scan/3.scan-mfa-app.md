## MFA Apps

Web applications often employ complex authentication mechanisms such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), CAPTCHAs, Single Sign-On (SSO), and OTPs to secure sensitive areas. These layers of protection, while essential for security, can make vulnerability scanning challenging. ZeroThreat Recorder Chrome Extension simplifies the process, enabling you to scan these protected sections without compromising accuracy.

This guide will walk you through performing an authenticated scan on an MFA-protected application.

##### **Minimize the ZeroThreat Recorder Chrome window**

###### You can minimize the recorder window but ensure the that it remains open throughout the recording process.
::
**Visit** [Troubleshooting: Extension Not Opening](../troubleshoot "mention") if the extension doesn't open automatically in new tab along with target.
### **3. Complete the Authentication Process**

- **Login with Credentials or any other method**: Enter your username and password for the application or any other login method.
- **Handle MFA**:
  - **OTP**: Enter the One-Time Password (OTP) sent to your email or phone.
  - **CAPTCHA**: Solve any CAPTCHA challenges that appear.
  - **SSO**: If using a Single Sign-On service like Google or Azure, log in with it.
- After this step you should be logged in to the application using any of the authentication method.

### 4. Stop the Recording

- After successfully logging in, click **Stop Recording** <img src="/image (135).png" alt="" width="15%" data-size="line" style="display:inline; margin:0px; margin-bottom:0px; translate: var(--tw-translate-x) -7px;">button in the ZeroThreat Recorder window.

> **Caution:** Ensure all authentication steps are completed before stopping the recording to avoid incomplete data capture.

 ##### **Stay Logged In**

###### Ensure that you remain logged into the target application throughout the scan to prevent session timeouts.
::

## Monitoring the Scan

- Navigate to the **Scans** section in the ZeroThreat portal to monitor the scan’s progress in real time.
- Review detailed reports to understand vulnerabilities in the authenticated areas.

## **Tips & Cautions**

1. **Stay Logged In**: Ensure you remain logged into the application throughout the scan to prevent session timeouts.
2. **Avoid Unnecessary Steps**: Perform only essential actions during the recording to keep the captured data clean.
3. **Handle Third-Party Services**: If your application interacts with external services during authentication (e.g., SSO), confirm that these services are accessible and functional during the scan.

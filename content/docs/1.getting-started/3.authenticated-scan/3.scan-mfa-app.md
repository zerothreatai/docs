## **MFA Apps**

ZeroThreat Recorder Chrome Extension simplifies the process of complex authentication mechanisms such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), CAPTCHAs, Single Sign-On (SSO), and OTPs to secure sensitive areas. It enables you to scan these protected sections without compromising accuracy. 

This guide will walk you through performing an authenticated scan on an MFA-protected application.

##### **Before you start**
###### Ensure that the latest version of ZeroThreat Chrome Recorder extension is installed on your chrome browser.
::

### **1. Select Your Target**

* In the ZeroThreat dashboard, click on **"Scan the Target"** and choose the application you wish to scan. Next change the scanning server if required.

##### **Minimize the ZeroThreat Recorder Chrome window**

###### You can minimize the recorder window but ensure the that it remains open throughout the recording process.

Visit [**Troubleshooting: Extension Not Opening**](../troubleshoot) if the extension doesn't open automatically in new tab along with target.

### **2. Configure the Recorder**

* Once the extension is loaded, Start by clicking on the **Active User Session Authentication(MFA)** button. Note that in this method ZeroThreat does not capture or store authentication details instead, it uses a live user session (token) for authorization. You must stay logged in until the scan runs on the server. This method is perfect for applications requiring captcha, multi-factor authentication (MFA), one-time passwords (OTP), or third-party OAuth.

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (184).png"}
Choose Scan Authentication Method
::

* Next youâ€™ll have two options **Full Scan** or **Scan Navigation Sequence Only**. A **Full Scan** covers the entire web application, while a navigation sequence-only scan focuses solely on the pages you visit during recording. In our example, lets select Full Scan.

Choose Scan Type

### **3. Complete the Authentication Process**

* **Login with Credentials or any other method**: Enter your username and password for the application or any other login method.
* **Handle MFA**:
  * **OTP**: Enter the One-Time Password (OTP) sent to your email or phone.
  * **CAPTCHA**: Solve any CAPTCHA challenges that appear.
  * **SSO**: If using a Single Sign-On service like Google or Azure, log in with it.
* After this step you should be logged in to the application using any of the authentication method.

### **4. Stop the Recording**

* After logging in successfully, navigate through 2-3 pages while authenticated, then click the **Stop Recording** (<img src="/Images/image (189).png" style="display:inline" alt="" data-size="line">) button in the ZeroThreat Recorder window.

::hint{ style="background-color:#fff4e6; color:#f97316; border:1px solid #f6d2b0;" icon="triangle-exclamation" iconClass="text-[#f97316]"}
###### Ensure all authentication steps are completed before stopping the recording to avoid incomplete data capture.
::


### **5 . Save and Scan**

* Choose the scanning server and click on **Start Scan** and the scan will start immediately.

##### **Stay Logged In**

###### Ensure that you remain logged into the target application throughout the scan to prevent session timeouts.
::

### **6. Monitoring the Scan**

*  The scan will start immediately and you can track its progress and view results in the **Scans** section or **Recent Scans** section in the ZeroThreat portal.

## **Tips & Cautions**

1. **Stay Logged In**: Ensure you remain logged into the application throughout the scan to prevent session timeouts.
2. **Avoid Unnecessary Steps**: Perform only essential actions during the recording to keep the captured data clean.
3. **Handle Third-Party Services**: If your application interacts with external services during authentication (e.g., SSO), confirm that these services are accessible and functional during the scan.

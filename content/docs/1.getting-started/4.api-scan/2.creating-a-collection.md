title: Creating a Collection
description: Before you can start an API Scan in ZeroThreat, you first need to create a **Collection**.
---

A **Collection** represents the source of your API endpoints and acts as the starting point for both **unauthenticated** and **authenticated** API scans. You can use it to scan public (unauthenticated) APIs right away, or later configure authentication for APIs that require it.

Here’s how you can create a collection in ZeroThreat.

## Step 1: Create an API Target

First, you need to create a **Target** that defines the base URL of your API and sets the scan type.

1. Go to the **Targets** section in ZeroThreat and click **“Add Target.”**
2. Enter the **Base URL** of your API (e.g., `https://api.example.com`).

3. Under **Scan Type**, select **API Scan** and choose your preferred **Scanning Server**.
4. Click **“Save”** to add the target.

## Step 2: Add an API Collection to Your Target

Once your target is set up:

1. From the ZeroThreat dashboard, select the API target you just created.
2. Click on **Create New Collection** (<img src="/Images/image (348).png" alt="" data-size="line">) button. This opens the **Configure API Collection** drawer, where you’ll choose your API Collection source method.

## Step 3: Select Your API Source Type

ZeroThreat offers four options for importing your API collection:

| Source Type            | Description                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Swagger File / URL** | Upload a Swagger file or provide a public Swagger URL.      |
| **OpenAPI File**       | Upload an OpenAPI (OAS) YAML or JSON file.                  |
| **Postman API**        | Import directly from a Postman collection.                  |
| **HAR File**           | Upload a HAR (HTTP Archive) file from captured API traffic. |

In this example, let’s choose the **Swagger** Source method:

* ZeroThreat will automatically give a name to your Collection Source according to previous collection names.
* Upload your Swagger file or enter the Swagger URL path (E.g. /api/v1/swagger.json) and click **Fetch Collection.** (Note: Enter the path alone, not the full URL).

* ZeroThreat will automatically parse all the API endpoints from the file or the URL.&#x20;


ZeroThreat will only display endpoints that fall within your defined **Target URL scope**.
This ensures scans are limited to assets you own and control.


## Step 4: Review and Configure API Endpoints

Once the API specification is parsed, click the **View Collection** (<img src="/Images/image (355).png" alt="" data-size="line">) button to see and review all the extracted API endpoints.

ZeroThreat highlight any endpoints that have missing or empty request bodies, these are commonly found in incomplete API specs. These endpoints will be marked with a **Payload Unmapped** ( <img src="/Images/image (354).png" alt="" data-size="line">) symbol to help you identify them.

While filling body for such API's is **not mandatory** to start a scan, it’s highly recommended. Providing sample data in request bodies helps ZeroThreat interact more accurately with your APIs, leading to more effective testing.

**(Optional Step) Map Missing Payloads**
Click any endpoint marked with the Payload Unmapped (<img src="/Images/image (354).png" alt="" data-size="line">) icon and provide sample request body data where needed.

You can also hover over the **Collection Analysis** (<img src="/Images/image (353).png" alt="" data-size="line">) button to get an overview of how many endpoints were parsed, and how many of them are missing request bodies.

Once you're done reviewing and configuring the endpoints, click **Save**.&#x20;

Your collection is now ready to use.
You can proceed to run an **Unauthenticated API Scan** or, if your APIs require authentication, configure **API Authentication settings** for this collection.

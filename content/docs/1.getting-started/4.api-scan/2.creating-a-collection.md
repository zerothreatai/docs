title: Creating a Collection
description: Before you can start an API Scan in ZeroThreat, you first need to create a **Collection**.
---

A **Collection** represents the source of your API endpoints and acts as the starting point for both **unauthenticated** and **authenticated** API scans. You can use it to scan public (unauthenticated) APIs right away, or later configure authentication for APIs that require it.

Here’s how you can create a collection in ZeroThreat.

## Step 1: Create an API Target

First, you need to create a **Target** that defines the base URL of your API and sets the scan type.

1. Go to the **Targets** section in ZeroThreat and click **“Add Target.”**
2. Enter the **Base URL** of your API (e.g., `https://api.example.com`).

::

3. Under **Scan Type**, select **API Scan** and choose your preferred **Scanning Server**.
4. Click **“Save”** to add the target.

## Step 2: Add an API Collection to Your Target

Once your target is set up:

1. From the ZeroThreat dashboard, select the API target you just created.
2. Click on **“Add API Collection.”**\
   This opens the **Collection Drawer**, where you’ll choose how to provide your API source.

## Step 3: Select Your API Source Type

ZeroThreat offers four options for importing your API collection:

| Source Type            | Description                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Swagger File / URL** | Upload a Swagger file or provide a public Swagger URL.      |
| **OpenAPI File**       | Upload an OpenAPI (OAS) YAML or JSON file.                  |
| **Postman API**        | Import directly from a Postman collection.                  |
| **HAR File**           | Upload a HAR (HTTP Archive) file from captured API traffic. |

In this example, let’s choose **Swagger File**:

* Select **Swagger File** from the source options.
* Upload your Swagger file or paste the Swagger URL and click **Fetch Collection**.

::

* ZeroThreat will automatically parse the file and list all API endpoints.

::hint{style="bg-#f5fdf9; border: 1px solid #10b98133; color:#0a8363;" icon="circle-check" iconClass="text-[#0a8363]"}
##### **Note:**

###### ZeroThreat will only display endpoints that fall within your defined **Target URL scope**.\
###### This ensures scans are limited to assets you own and control.
::

## Step 4: Review and Configure API Endpoints

After parsing:

* ZeroThreat will show all the API endpoints it found.
* Some endpoints may have **missing payloads** or **empty request bodies.** (especially common with incomplete API specs).

Before saving:

1. Review the list of endpoints.
2. For any endpoint missing payloads or body parameters:
   * Provide **sample data**, **payload values**, or **request bodies** where required.

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (265).png"}

::
::hint{ style="background-color:#fff4e6; color:#f97316; border:1px solid #f6d2b0;" icon="triangle-exclamation" iconClass="text-[#f97316]"}
###### APIs with missing request data cannot be fully tested. Adding this missing payload makes sure ZeroThreat can properly interact with your endpoints.
::
::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (266).png"}

::

Fill those API requests that have missing values in JSON with proper data.
3. Once everything is configured and reviewed: Click “Save”.

Your collection is now ready to use.\
You can proceed to run an **Unauthenticated API Scan** or, if your APIs require authentication, configure **API Authentication settings** for this collection.

seo.title: Creating a Collection – Set Up API source for Scanning
description: Before you can start an API Scan in ZeroThreat, you first need to create a **Collection**.
seo.description: Setup your API source by creating a collection in ZeroThreat. Import via Swagger, OpenAPI, Postman, or HAR to prepare for authenticated or public scans.
---

A **Collection** represents the source of your API endpoints and acts as the starting point for both **unauthenticated** and **authenticated** API scans. You can use it to scan public (unauthenticated) APIs right away, or later configure authentication for APIs that require it.

Here’s how you can create a collection in ZeroThreat.

## Step 1: Create an API Target

First, you need to create a **Target** that defines the base URL of your API and sets the scan type.

1. Go to the **Targets** section in ZeroThreat and click **“Add Target.”**
2. Enter the **Base URL** of your API (e.g., `https://api.example.com`).

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (51).png"}
::
3. Under **Scan Type**, select **API Scan** and choose your preferred **Scanning Server**.
4. Click **“Save”** to add the target.

## Step 2: Add an API Collection to Your Target

Once your target is set up:

1. From the ZeroThreat dashboard, select the API target you just created.
2. Click on **Create New Collection** (<img src="/Images/image (348).png" alt="" data-size="line">) button. This opens the **Configure API Collection** drawer, where you’ll choose your API Collection source method.

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (349).png"}
::

## Step 3: Select Your API Source Type

ZeroThreat offers four options for importing your API collection:

| Source Type            | Description                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Swagger File / URL** | Upload a Swagger file or provide a public Swagger URL.                        |
| **OpenAPI File**       | Upload an OpenAPI (OAS) YAML or JSON file.                                    |
| **Postman API**        | Import directly from a Postman collection.                                    |
| **HAR File**           | Upload a HAR (HTTP Archive) file from captured API traffic.                   |
| **RAML**               | Upload RAML definitions to import resources and request details for API scan. |
| **WADL**               | Upload WADL service descriptions to import endpoints/operations for API scan. |

In this example, let’s choose the **Swagger** Source method:

* Enter a short and meaningful name for your Collection, within 6 characters. Use a simple identifier such as SWG-01, COL-01, or API-01 to help you recognize it later.
* Upload your Swagger file or enter the Swagger URL path (E.g. /api/v1/swagger.json) and click **Fetch Collection.** (Note: Enter the path alone, not the full URL).

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (350).png"}
::

* ZeroThreat will automatically parse all the API endpoints from the file or the URL.&#x20;

::hint{style="bg-#f5fdf9; border: 1px solid #10b98133; color:#0a8363;" icon="circle-check" iconClass="text-[#0a8363]"}
###### ZeroThreat will only display endpoints that fall within your defined **Target URL scope**.
###### This ensures scans are limited to assets you own and control.
::

### Cloud API Collection

In addition to uploading files or providing URLs, ZeroThreat supports creating Collections directly from your **cloud API management platforms**. This is useful if your APIs are already published and versioned in cloud-native services.

ZeroThreat supports five cloud integrations. Each method lets you authenticate against your cloud provider, fetch available APIs, and import them directly into ZeroThreat for scanning. Below are the steps to fetch API collection from each of them.

<details>

<summary><strong>1. Azure API Management (APIM)</strong></summary>

If your APIs are managed in **Azure API Management (APIM)**, you can directly import them into ZeroThreat as a Collection for scanning.

**Steps to Import API collection from Azure APIM**

1. **Login to Azure**
   Make sure you are logged into your Azure Portal. From the Configure API Collection drawer in ZeroThreat, select Azure APIM as your collection source.

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (380).png"}

## Step 4: Review and Configure API Endpoints

Once the API specification is parsed, you will be able to see all the extracted API endpoints.

::hint{ style="background-color:#fef2f2; border:1px solid #e3b1b166; color:#cd3131;" icon="triangle-exclamation" iconClass="text-red-500"}
##### Troubleshoot:
###### If the API specification is parsed but shows zero endpoints, it usually means that the Collection source and the Target you created are using different hostname.
    ::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (397).png"}
    ::
##### To fix this, create a new Target with the correct API base domain, and then create your Collection within that Target. 
::

ZeroThreat highlight any endpoints that have missing or empty request bodies, these are commonly found in incomplete API specs. These endpoints will be marked with a **Payload Unmapped** ( <img src="/Images/image (354).png" alt="" data-size="line">) symbol to help you identify them.

While filling body for such API's is **not mandatory** to start a scan, it’s highly recommended. Providing sample data in request bodies helps ZeroThreat interact more accurately with your APIs, leading to more effective testing.

**(Optional Step) Map Missing Payloads**
Click any endpoint marked with the Payload Unmapped (<img src="/Images/image (354).png" alt="" data-size="line">) icon and provide sample request body data where needed.

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (351).png"}
::

You can also hover over the **Collection Analysis** (<img src="/Images/image (353).png" alt="" data-size="line">) button to get an overview of how many endpoints were parsed, and how many of them are missing request bodies.

::fiqure-img{source="/Images/image (352).png"}
::

::hint{style="bg-#f5fdf9; border: 1px solid #10b98133; color:#0a8363;" icon="circle-check" iconClass="text-[#0a8363]"}
##### **Snapshot Difference Detected**

When you create a new API Collection on a target where a previous collection already exists, ZeroThreat automatically compares the new collection against the previous one.

If differences are found, the system will display a **“Snapshot difference detected”** message in the Collection Analysis panel.

This feature helps you:

* **Auto-populate missing values:** Any empty payload fields in the new collection will be filled using data from your previous collection (if available).
* **Identify new endpoints:** ZeroThreat highlights any new endpoints detected since the last collection snapshot, allowing you to easily see what has changed.

This helps you keep your collections updated without losing previously configured payloads.
::
Once you're done reviewing and configuring the endpoints, click **Save**.&#x20;

Your collection is now ready to use.
You can proceed to run an **Unauthenticated API Scan** or, if your APIs require authentication, configure **API Authentication settings** for this collection.

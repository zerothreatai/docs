description: Integrating your issue tracking system with ZeroThreat allows you to manage security vulnerabilities directly from within Jira. This not only streamlines the managment between security and engineering teams but also makes vulnerability remediation a part of your existing sprint workflow. With just a few clicks, you can authorize Jira, select the right sprint, and create actionable tickets with full technical contextâ€”no copy-pasting or exporting required.

Whether you're running periodic scans or have a fully automated CI/CD pipeline, this integration ensures that every confirmed vulnerability gets the visibility and focus within your existing Jira board.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following:

* Your target application is **verified** on ZeroThreat.
* You have a **Jira account** with the appropriate permissions to create issues.
* You are logged into the correct Jira workspace in your browser.

## Step 1: Connect ZeroThreat to Jira

1. Navigate to the **Targets** (<img src="/Images/image (44).png" alt="" data-size="line">)section in ZeroThreat.
2. Click on the **"Continuous Integration"** button (<img src="/Images/image (207).png" alt="" data-size="line">) for your desired target.
3. In the configuration drawer,  click on the **Issue Tracking** (<img src="/Images/image (208).png" alt="" data-size="line">) section.
4. Locate **Jira** and click the **"Authorize"** button.

A new browser tab will open. Click **"Accept"** on the Jira authorization screen. Once authorized, youâ€™ll be redirected back to your ZeroThreat dashboard.

## Step 2: Create Jira Issues from a Scan Report

Once Jira is connected:

1. Go to the **Scans (**<img src="/Images/image (210).png" alt="" data-size="line">**)** section in ZeroThreat.
2. Open any completed **scan report**.
3. Click the **"Jira Task"** (<img src="/Images/image (211).png" alt="" data-size="line">) button at the top of the report.

A Jira integration popup will appear with multiple configuration options.

## Step 3: Configure Jira Issue Settings

In the Jira Task popup:

1. Select your **Jira instance** (workspace).
2. Choose the **Project**, **Board**, and **Sprint** where you want vulnerabilities to be tracked.
   * ðŸ“Œ _All issues will be automatically added to the selected sprint._

## Step 4: Create Issues for Vulnerabilities

1. In the scan report, identify the **vulnerability** you want to assign.
2. Click **"Create Issue"** next to it.
3. ZeroThreat will generate **individual Jira tickets** for each instance (finding) under that vulnerability type.

<!-- <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (198).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> -->

All tickets are immediately pushed to Jira and can be tracked from either platform.

## Step 5: View and Manage Issues in Jira

* Go to **Created Issues** in ZeroThreat to see all Jira tickets generated for that scan.

::
<!-- <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (199).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> -->

* Click on any issue to open it directly in Jira.
* Inside each Jira issue, you'll find:
  * A **detailed description** of the vulnerability
  * HTTP **request and response headers**
  * **Evidence** (such as parameters, payloads, or proof of concept)
  * A link back to the full scan report in ZeroThreat

## Step 6: Bi-directional Comment Sync

You can manage collaboration across teams without switching platforms:

* Leave comments in the **Jira issue** â€” they will automatically appear in the corresponding entry in ZeroThreat.
* Add comments from within **ZeroThreat** â€” they will be synced back to Jira.

This ensures both **security** and **engineering** teams stay aligned on context and progress.

***

## Step 7: Monitor Issue Status in ZeroThreat

To view the current status of the issues created, open the scan report where you initially generated the Jira tickets. Click on the **Jira Task** button once again and select the same sprint you used earlier. This will display the latest details for each ticket, including its **priority**, the assigned **team member**, and the current **status**â€”such as _To Do_, _In Progress_, or _Done_â€”just as you would see directly in Jira.

This provides a central security-focused view of your development teamâ€™s progress on remediation.

## Best Practices

* Create Jira issues only for **validated** and **high-priority** vulnerabilities to avoid noise.
* Align sprint planning with **scan schedules** for better vulnerability resolution velocity.

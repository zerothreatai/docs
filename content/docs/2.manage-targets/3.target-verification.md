### 2. Choose a Verification Method

ZeroThreat provides two methods for domain verification:

**Method 1: HTML File Deployment**

1. **Download the verification file**: ZeroThreat will generate a unique `zero-threat.html` file for your domain.
2. **Upload the file** to the **root directory** of your web application.
   - Example path: `https://yourdomain.com/zero-threat.html`
3. **Verify file accessibility** by visiting the provided URL(e.g., `https://vulnerable.zerothreat.ai/zero-threat.html`).

##### **Ensure the correct placement**

###### When using HTML file verification, place the file in the root directory, not in a subfolder.

::

**Method 2: DNS TXT Record Entry**

1. **Copy the TXT record** provided by ZeroThreat.
2. **Log in to your DNS provider** (e.g., Cloudflare, GoDaddy, AWS Route 53).
3. **Navigate to the DNS settings** for your domain.
4. **Add a new TXT record** with the copied verification value.
5. **Save the changes** (reflecting the change may take a few minutes).

##### **Allow time for DNS propagation**

###### Some DNS providers take longer to update, so TXT record verification might not be instant.

::

### 3. Complete the Verification

- After completing **either** of the above methods, return to **ZeroThreat** and click the **Verify** button.
- ZeroThreat will check and validate your domain ownership.
- Once verification is successful, the target will be marked as **Verified** <span><img src="/Images/image (32).png" alt=""></span>, allowing you to proceed with scanning.

Now that your target is verified, learn about [**Target Configuration**](target-configuration 'mention')!&#x20;

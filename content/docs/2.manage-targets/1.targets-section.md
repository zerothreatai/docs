## Add a Target

Click on the Add Target <span><img src="/Images/image (49).png" alt="" width="30px" data-size="line"></span> button to add a new target. This will open a **add new target** popup.

Refer the [**Add a Target**](add-a-target 'mention') guide for detailed guide on how to add a new target.

## Target List and Sorting

When you access the Targets section, you'll see a comprehensive list of all your targets. To help you navigate and organize these Targets effectively, you have several options:

- **Group By**: Use the _Group By_ <img src="/Images/image (54).png" alt="" data-size="line"> button to sort targets based on:

  - **Hostname**: Group targets according to their respective hostnames.
  - **Organizations**: Sort targets based on the organizations they belong to.

* **Default View**: If no sorting option is applied, targets will be displayed based on the most recent activity.

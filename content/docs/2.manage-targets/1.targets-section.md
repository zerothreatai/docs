## Add a Target

Click on the Add Target <img src="/image (49).png" alt="" data-size="line" style="display:inline; padding:0px; margin: 0px; width:25px;"> button to add a new target. This will open a **add new target** popup.

Refer the [Add a Target](add-a-target.md "mention") guide for detailed guide on how to add a new target.

## Target List and Sorting

When you access the Targets section, you'll see a comprehensive list of all your targets. To help you navigate and organize these Targets effectively, you have several options:

*   **Group By**: Use the _Group By_  <img src="/image (54).png" alt="" data-size="line" style="display:inline">  button to sort targets based on:

    * **Hostname**: Group targets according to their respective hostnames.
    * **Organizations**: Sort targets based on the organizations they belong to.



<img src="/image (53).png" alt="">
* **Default View**: If no sorting option is applied, targets will be displayed based on the most recent activity.

You can click on the <img src="/image (47).png" alt="" data-size="original" style="display:inline; margin:0px; padding:0px;"> icon to open target configuration settings for the target.

Refer the [Target Configuration](target-configuration.md "mention") guide to know about each configuration in detail.

## Domain Verification

To scan a target, domain ownership verification is required. To verify a domain you can click on   <img src="/image (48).png" alt="" data-size="original" style="display:inline; margin:0px 2px; padding:0px;">   button.

::hint{style="background-color:#f7fcff; border:1px solid #07405a33; color:#1e6995;" icon="circle-info" iconClass="text-sky-600"}
<h6> Domain verification ensures you’re authorized to scan the target, preventing unauthorized scans.</h6>

Refer the [Domain Verification](domain-verification.md "mention") guide to learn how to verify your domain with ZeroThreat before scanning.

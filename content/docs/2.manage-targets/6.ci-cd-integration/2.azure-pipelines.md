In this guide, we’ll walk through how to set up the integration using a basic example. You can follow along with the example, or customize the steps to fit your own Azure DevOps workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

* Make sure your target is **verified** in ZeroThreat.
* You have an **Azure DevOps project** with pipeline permissions.
* You’re familiar with the basics of **Azure** and **Azure Pipelines.**
* Your source code repository is connected to Azure (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket, or Azure Repos).

### Step 1. Enable GitHub Actions Integration in ZeroThreat

1. Navigate to the **Targets** (<img src="/Images/image (44).png " alt="" data-size="line">)section in ZeroThreat.
2. Click on the **"Continuous Integration"** button (<img src="/Images/image (218).png" alt="" data-size="line">) for your desired target.

::

3. In the CI/CD settings drawer, enable **Azure Pipelines** integration and confirm.

::

Once confirmed, a unique **ZT\_TOKEN** will be generated. This token is used to start scans CI/CD for its associated target from the CI/CD.

### Step 2: Choose Scan Settings

1. Select or create a **Scan Profile** suitable for your environment.

###### A scan profile is required for API scans in CI/CD integration. Without it, the integration pipeline cannot start the scan.
::

2. If you're scanning authenticated sections of your app, select the appropriate **Login Template** for authenticated scans.

###### Make sure to select a working Login template for Authenticated Scan.
::

### Step 3: Open the Azure Pipelines Marketplace

Click on the **Azure Pipelines** icon in ZeroThreat to open the [**Azure DevOps Marketplace**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/), where you’ll find the official [**ZeroThreat AI DAST Scanner**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ZeroThreatAIDASTScanner.zt-azure-devops) from Marketplace.

### Step 4: Create a Pipeline in Azure DevOps

1. Open your Azure DevOps Project.
2. Go to **Pipelines → Create Pipeline**.

::

3. In this guide, we’ll use the **Classic Editor** (<img src="/Images/image (236).png" alt="" data-size="line" size="height:30px">) for setup clarity. Choose your **project source**, connect your repository, and select the relevant branch or build definition.
4. When prompted to choose a template, you can select a recommended one or click **“Empty Job”** to build from scratch.

::

### Step 5: Configure the Agent Job

1. Create a new **Agent Job** and name it.&#x20;
2. Select an **Agent Pool** and **Agent Specification** (e.g., `ubuntu-latest` or your default pool).

::

3. Click **“Save and Queue”** to create the pipeline structure.

### Step 6: Add the ZeroThreat Scan Task

1. Search for **ZeroThreat AI DAST Scanner** in the task list.
2. Add it to the Agent Job.
3. Provide your **ZT\_TOKEN** (the one generated in ZeroThreat).
4. Set **Wait for Analysis** to `true` or `false`:
   * `false` (default): The scan starts and the pipeline moves on.
   * `true`: The pipeline waits for the scan to complete before proceeding.

##### **Best Practice:**  
###### Store your `ZT_TOKEN` securely in Azure DevOps as a pipeline variable or secret to avoid exposing it in your build logs or version control.
::
***

### Step 7: Run the Pipeline

1. Once everything is configured, click **“Save and Queue”**.
2. The Agent Job will start, and you'll see the scan triggered in real-time in your ZeroThreat dashboard.

## Customizing Your Integration

The above setup is a basic example using a manual trigger and the classic editor, but you can easily customize it to fit your workflow:

* **Trigger scans automatically** on every push, pull request, or tag
* **Schedule scans** at regular intervals using cron expressions
* **Include scan stages in larger workflows** for build → test → security → deploy pipelines

This flexibility ensures you can integrate security testing exactly when and where it makes sense in your CI/CD process.
